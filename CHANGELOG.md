  using a local checkout of the package for testing.

## v1.0.3

* Uses the latest version of the Algolia DocSearch JavaScript library.
* Supports using a specific CSS theme bundle, as defined by the `css_bundle` setting in the deployment's configuration, allowing individual deployments to have isolated CSS bundles, while still sharing most all of the LESS source.  This is automatically set in the global configurations and no changes are necessary. The existing bundle is still being served in the same location as a fallback.  This change eliminates the need for individual deployments to specify their own colors in their `./assets/theme-colors.less` file, but maintains the support for the file in case individual deployments necessitate it in the future.
  [PR #56](https://github.com/meteor/meteor-theme-hexo/pull/56)
